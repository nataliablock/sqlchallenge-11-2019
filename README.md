My answers to a take-home SQL coding challenge 


In this repository, you will find a txt file with my answers to a take-home coding challenge that I completed for a position at a tech company. I removed the name of the company from my answers and do not provide the actual text of the challenge itself. I just provide the code that I wrote, which I own, for study/educational purposes and to showcase my coding and problem-solving skills.
